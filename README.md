# TutorialDataAnalysis

This is a tutorial on data analysis with Python. It might also include some discussion on languages like STATA and etc.

I wrote this tutorial because a friend of mine would like to use Python for her study in the program "Master in Econometrics" at Erasmus University Rotterdam. Some quantitative courses requires certain amount of programming work. She would like to choose a programming language as her main tool for the assignments. Among several statistical softwares/languages, I particularly recommend them Python.

Python is a good language to me in terms of scientific calculation and statistical analysis because it is simple but powerful. It is a general programming language, which means that you can use it for daily work besides your study. There is a lot of highly-optimized packages for statistics and data science, which means that you could easily find a proper one for your assignments. The syntax of Python is concise and the language is dynamic, which means you could run it line by line and do not need to declare the type of the variables.

Finally, Python "learns" a lot from other softwares/languages. The matrix expressions and scientific calculations (numpy and scipy) are learned from Matlab. The data storage and processing (pandas) are learned from R. That means that you can easily understand the logic of and switch to other statistical softwares/programs when you are familiar with Python.

When you are learning this new language, I highly suggest that you "learn by coding". Do not just read, but type your codes and run them. Only by doing so you understand how to program in Python by heart.

I will write and improve this tutorial every day, but not too much each time. A basic assumption is that you have already certain level of knowledge| in quantitative methods and programming. This is, above all, not a programming tutorial but a tutorial on data analysis. I will keep the "basic things in computer science" in short and go quickly to the core issues that will be frequently used by a quantitative and econometrics guy.

Good luck with your study and hope that you enjoy this fantastic language!
